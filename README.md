## 🚨 Problem Statement

In today’s digital world, printing sensitive documents (Aadhaar, passports, legal papers, etc.) at local print shops poses a serious security risk.  
Documents often remain stored on shop computers, making them vulnerable to:

- ❌ Identity theft
- ❌ Unauthorized duplication
- ❌ Financial fraud
- ❌ Spam and misuse

## 💡 Our Solution

The Secure Document Printing System eliminates these risks by:

- ✅ Encrypting documents with AES-256 before sharing  
- ✅ Enabling one-time, self-destructing print links  
- ✅ Ensuring no storage of files on shop systems  
- ✅ Using key exchange mechanisms for secure transfer  
- ✅ Supporting WhatsApp-based file sharing for unregistered shops  
- ✅ Adding an anti-forensic layer to prevent disk recovery or RAM dumps
